# blockpress.me

A customizable / themeable content hosting system for blockchain data, which can be used at any static hosting site.

The blockpress.me repo holds the server-side setup for blockpress.me.

See also repo https://github.com/miblodge/projectb which holds the static pages served here:

- E.g https://hkjn.blockpress.me is served from https://github.com/miblodge/projectb/tree/master/hkjn 

_TODO(hkjn): Add Makefile to allow deploying statically built binaries to Github releases, and set up bootstrap .json
on host to fetch these binaries from there, so we can pick
up new CoreOS releases and reboot without manual action
to restore services._
